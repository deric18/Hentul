Cuurent Feature :  Support of Hippocampus for Classification.

Major Sub Features:
1. Provide support for Spatial Map of the environment around the agent with Boundary cells, Grid cell like Graph Cells storing locations of objects.
2. Support and classify Favourite spots for every object for easier classification and differentiation.
3. Provide Support for Path Integration for the agent So it can move from position to position with Burst Avoidance along the path for self assertion of the computed path.


Implementation:
1. SPATIAL MAP:

- Can static SOM BBM support multiple objects ? if not undo all the singleton logic.
