Small Direction
- Refactor Code 
- Introduce Learning LearningUnit
- Refactor Vision Processor and Text Processor to use Learningunit for init , process , and depolarization
- Update the record pixel logic to process pixels and store senseloc only when there is real data to store. [Put null check in senseloc]
