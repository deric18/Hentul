1. Second Order memory will provide context for the context of the incoming pattern.
2. Both order of memories provide an excellent mechanism for storing patterns and predicting intelligence.
3. Associative memory works like a graph between different regions of the broader network.




Questions:
1. How to assemble location into the system ? (sensory motor inference).
2. Also the motor signal from the motor cortex.





THOUGHTS TO KEPP I NMIND :
1. First Order memory is specifically designed to understand highly repetitive patterns and bubble the ones that are highly rep[petitive for higher layers to make sense of.
2. Neocortex is the slow brain , it takes hours to days for new synapes to form and consistent effort on the same task to learn the pattern , The hippocampal complex on the other hand is a fast learning system , it can learn things quickly
but it cannot store all the learning for longer term it can store for short term.
