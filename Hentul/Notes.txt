1. Second Order memory will provide context for the context of the incoming pattern.
2. Both order of memories provide an excellent mechanism for storing patterns and predicting intelligence.
3. Associative memory works like a graph between different regions of the broader network.




Questions:
1. How to assemble location into the system ? (sensory motor inference).
2. Also the motor signal from the motor cortex.





THOUGHTS TO KEPP I NMIND :
1. First Order memory is specifically designed to understand highly repetitive patterns and bubble the ones that are highly rep[petitive for higher layers to make sense of.
